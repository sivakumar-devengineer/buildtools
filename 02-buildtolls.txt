.NET APP:
==========
1)
.NET is a free, open-source platform by Microsoft used to build applications like:
    Websites, Desktop apps, Mobile apps, Games, Cloud services

2)
In .NET, the main tool used for build  is the dotnet command-line tool.

3)
Step-by-Step Guide from Scratch
    a)
    Install .NET SDK
    download and install the .NET SDK (Software Development Kit)

    b)
    Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
        If you're using Windows:
        Press Windows + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
    c)
    Create a New Project
    $ dotnet new console -n MyFirstApp
    What this does:
        dotnet new = creates a new project
        console = type of app (a simple text-based app)
        -n MyFirstApp = project name is "MyFirstApp"

    d)
    after entering into folder MyFirstApp
    Understand the Files
    When you run dotnet new, it creates:
    
    File/Folder	         What It Does
    Program.cs	 -->     This is the main code file. It has C# code that runs your app.
    MyFirstApp.csproj -->	This file describes your project (kind of like a recipe).
    obj/ and bin/ folders -->	These will be created when you build.

    e)
    Run the App Without Building
    $ dotnet run
        This command compiles and runs your app at the same time.

    $ dotnet build
        To only build (without running):
    What happens now:
        .NET reads the .csproj file (your project info).
        It finds and compiles the code in Program.cs.
        It creates output files in the bin/Debug/net8.0/ folder.

    f)
    Where is the Output?
    Go to:
        MyFirstApp/bin/Debug/net8.0/

        MyFirstApp.dll ← this is the main compiled app
        $ dotnet MyFirstApp.dll

    g)dotnet restore
        The restore step usually happens automatically when  runs 
        dotnet build or dotnet run 

4)
A solution file is a file with the extension .sln that:
✅ Organizes
✅ Connects
✅ Manages

…multiple projects in a .NET workspace.

5) diff b/w .dll and .exe 
File Type	Stands For	What It Does
.exe -->	Executable File	--> Runs as a program (you can double-click it)
.dll --> 	Dynamic Link Library -->	Cannot run by itself — used by other programs
